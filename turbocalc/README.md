# Web Services for the Turbocalendulator Project

This project contains the REST web services used by the Turbocalendulator project.  The primary consumer is the [turbocalendulator-web](https://github.com/dohall/turbocalendulator-web/) frontend.

# Overview

The web services are built with [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) running on a [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) server.  The code is built to run on the Heroku platform - information on running this locally can be found in the documentation.

# Documentation

Documentation can be found on the [turbocalendulator-services wiki page](https://github.com/dohall/turbocalendulator-services/wiki) on GitHub.  This includes service contracts, local development environment information, and more.

A rough diagram showing the services and their implementation methods is available: [Web Service Diagram.pdf](https://github.com/dohall/turbocalendulator-services/blob/master/docs/Web%20Service%20Diagram.pdf)
